    "Q1: Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique used to address multicollinearity in multiple regression models. It differs from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalty Term: Ridge Regression includes a penalty term (L2 regularization) in the loss function, in addition to the least squares loss term. This penalty term encourages the model to keep the coefficients (parameters) small, which helps in reducing the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Ridge Regression is primarily used for improving the stability of the regression coefficients when there is multicollinearity, whereas OLS aims to find the best-fitting linear model without considering multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficient Shrinkage: Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but they are not forced to be exactly zero. OLS does not shrink coefficients."

    "Q4: Ridge Regression for Feature Selection:\n",
    "Ridge Regression does not perform feature selection in the sense of setting coefficients to exactly zero. However, it shrinks coefficients toward zero, making some of them very close to zero. This has a feature selection effect in practice, as it reduces the impact of less important features.\n",

    "If you want strict feature selection (i.e., setting some coefficients to exactly zero), you may consider Lasso Regression, which combines L1 regularization and tends to yield sparse models."

    "Q5: Ridge Regression and Multicollinearity:\n",
    "Ridge Regression is effective at handling multicollinearity, which is a situation where independent variables are highly correlated. It achieves this by adding a penalty term that encourages the model to shrink the coefficients. As a result, Ridge Regression stabilizes the coefficients, reducing their sensitivity to small changes in the data. This can lead to more reliable and interpretable results in the presence of multicollinearity."

For categorical variables, you typically encode them using techniques like one-hot encoding or dummy variables before applying Ridge Regression. This allows the model to handle categorical variables effectively by representing them as binary indicator variables."
